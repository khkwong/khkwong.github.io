## Riot Games
* [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) - Riot's tactical FPS is currently my most played game with friends.

* [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) - Great rougelike, deck-building game that I play on and off ocassionally. Still yet to get to A20 on the Defect <img src="ahhh.png" alt="drawing" width="30px"/>
* [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/500/Left_4_Dead/) - The GOAT when it comes to multiplayer cooperative shooters. Back 4 Blood could never.
* [Sekiro Shadows Die Twice](https://www.sekirothegame.com) - Such a smooth combat system, got me hooked on Soulsborne titles.
* [Risk of Rain 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632360/Risk_of_Rain_2/) - Third person rougelike shooter that could also be played coop? Sign me up.
* [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/landing) - Played a ton right before entering college and still ocassionaly get on to grind relics even now.
* [Metal Gear Rising Revengeance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/235460/METAL_GEAR_RISING_REVENGEANCE/) - This game is epicness incarnate, the ultimate power fantasy. Really makes you <i>feel</i> like a badass cyborg ninja taking on an American politician.
* [CSGO/CS2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/) - RIP CSGO, but at least you gave me a foundation for Valorant.

## Console Games
* [Halo CE/2/3/4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/) - Linked the MCC since its easier, but damn these games made my childhood on the Xbox 360. I know every campaign level like the back of my hand, not to mention my bookshelf of assorted Halo literature.
* [Super Smash Brothers Brawl/4/Ultimate](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/) - Only fighting game I play, and the only one I think I need to. I suck though, and please bring back Subspace Emissary Nintendo.
* [Mario Party](https://marioparty.nintendo.com) - Many guffaws shared with friends.
* [Kirby's Return to Dreamland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Return_to_Dream_Land) - Kirby game, Kirby game, Kirby game... I still need to get to Forgotten Land.
* [Mario Odyssey](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-odyssey-switch/) - How is this even real. Its so good. Actually made me reminisce about my childhood days of playing Mario Galaxy.
* [Mario Kart](https://mariokart8.nintendo.com) - Came with the Switch, still think Mario Kart Wii is the best

## Gacha Games (Don't look, you can leave now)
* [Zenless Zone Zero](https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/ua) - Why does Hoyoverse have such a grip on me man, this games is too pretty.
* [Honkai Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/) - Latest gacha obsession, no I will not be taking any further questions.
* [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/) - I stopped playing religiously, come back every now and again.
* [Puzzles and Dragons](https://www.puzzleanddragons.us) - Legacy gacha game for me, played it ever since middle school.
* [Wuthering Waves](wutheringwaves.kurogames-ads.com) - Like the gameplay, honestly prefer this combat loop better than the Hoyo games, unfortunately everything else falls a bit short forme.
