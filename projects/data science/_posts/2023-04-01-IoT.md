# Debugging Internal States of IoT Devices
In my junior year at UCSD, I took part in a new [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) class being offered in the Data Science curriculum. During the class, I worked with two other classmates alongside assistant professor [Haojian Jin](http://shift-3.com) in creating a data pipeline that gathered fine-grained signal data that emanated from a Philips Hue Smart Bulb before training a CNN to classify what the bulb was doing based on that gathered data. I would then go on to further this work by expanding to other IoT devices, including the Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home.

## Data Gathered and Technology Used
* [HackRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackRF_One) - Software Defined Radio device that allowed us to gather data on the nearby EM field activity. Programmed using [GNURadio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR).
* Ethernet sniffer - Attached to devices to gather data on network usage
* Oscilloscope - Used to gather power consumption.
